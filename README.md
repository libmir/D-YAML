## Introduction

`mir-yaml` is an open source YAML parser and emitter library for the D programming language.
It is [almost](docs/articles/spec_differences.md) compliant to the YAML 1.1 specification.
`mir-yaml` is based on [PyYAML](http://www.pyyaml.org) created by Kirill Simonov.

`mir-yaml` is designed to be easy to use while supporting the full feature set of YAML.
To start using it in your project, see the [Getting Started](docs/tutorials/getting_started.md) tutorial.

## Mir specific Features
  - Integration with Mir serialisation engine. See also the [example](examples/mir_serde).
  - Precise number printing (Ryu) and parsing (required by YAML spec).
  - Support for Arbitrary timestamp precision (required by YAML spec).
  - Support for [Timestamp](http://mir-algorithm.libmir.org/mir_timestamp.html) (Mir), `YearMonthDay` (Mir), `Date` (Mir and Phobos), `DateTime`, `SysTime`.
  - `YamlAlgebraic` is full featured [Mir Algebraic](http://mir-core.libmir.org/mir_algebraic.html).

## Features
  - Easy to use, high level API and detailed debugging messages.
  - Detailed API documentation and tutorials.
  - Code examples.
  - Supports all YAML 1.1 constructs. All examples from the YAML 1.1
    specification are parsed correctly.
  - Reads from and writes from/to YAML files or in-memory buffers.
  - UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings are supported, both big and
    little endian (plain ASCII also works as it is a subset of UTF-8).
  - Support for both block (Python-like, based on indentation) and flow
    (JSON-like, based on bracing) constructs.
  - Support for YAML anchors and aliases.
  - Support for default values in mappings.
  - Support for custom tags (data types), and implicit tag resolution
    for custom scalar tags.
  - All tags (data types) described at <http://yaml.org/type/> are
    supported, with the exception of `tag:yaml.org,2002:yaml`, which is
    used to represent YAML code in YAML.
  - Remembers YAML style information between loading and dumping if
    possible.
  - Reuses input memory and uses slices to minimize memory allocations.
  - There is no support for recursive data structures. There are no
    plans to implement this at the moment.
